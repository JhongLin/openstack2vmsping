Basically I had to change permissions for two folder,
sudo chown -R stack:stack /opt/devstack OR sudo chown -R stack:stack /opt/stack/devstack (acc to the setup on my machine)
Consequently, while running the installation, the cache folder was having permissions issue so I ran the command again for that specific folder:

sudo chown -R stack:stack /opt/stack/.cache

install python


source openrc
openstack server start vm


Devstack previously had a ./rejoin-stack.sh that allows to resume the state of your devstack.

However, this patch removes that script.

Based on the description on that patch, the best way is to ./unstack.sh and ./clean.sh, then ./stack.sh again.
